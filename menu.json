Itself a descendant of indigenous Afghani and Thai landrace strains, Northern Lights has given rise to famous hybrids like Shiva Skunk and Super Silver Haze. Pungently sweet, spicy aromas radiate from the crystal-coated buds, which sometimes reveal themselves in hues of purple.

Comfortable laziness allows patients to relieve pain and sleeplessness, while its mellow contentment roots out depression and stress. The #5 strain was first entered into competition in 1989.

With a sweet and earthy aroma, GSC launches you to euphorias top floor where full-body relaxation meets a time-bending cerebral space. A little goes a long way with this hybrid, whose THC heights have won GSC numerous Cannabis Cup awards. Patients needing a strong dose of relief, however, may look to GSC for severe pain, nausea, and appetite loss. There are several different phenotypes of the GSC strain including Thin Mint and Platinum Cookies, which exhibit some variation in appearance and effect. Typically, however, GSC expresses its beauty in twisting green calyxes wrapped in purple leaves and fiery orange hairs. <p><br>Top Terpenes: Myrcene, Caryophyllene, Humulene <p><br>(Description provided Cure Pennsylvania &amp; Leafly.com)",

        "body_html": "<p><br>Harlequin is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain renowned for its reliable expression of CBD. A descendant of Colombian Gold, a Nepali indica, and Thai and Swiss landrace strains, you can depend on Harlequin to provide clear-headed, alert sativa effects. Unlike most high-CBD strains, Harlequin almost always develops a CBD:THC ratio of 5:2, making this strain one of the most effective out there for treatment of pain and anxiety, as CBD can counteract THCs paranoia while amplifying its painkilling properties. Flavors can range from earthy musk to sweet mango, but without a doubt, what draws crowds to Harlequin is its ability to relax without sedation and to relieve without intoxication. <p><br>Top Terpenes: Caryophyllene, Terpinolene, Limonene <p><br>(Description provided by Leafly.com)",

This bud has small and piecey light minty green nugs with dark green leaves, rich amber hairs, and a super frosty coating of tiny crystal trichomes. Chem DD starts with a subtly relaxing uplifted euphoria that launches your mind into pure bliss. This is accompanied by a building body buzz that washes over you in warming waves of relaxation. Chem DD is often used to treat conditions such as depression, chronic stress or anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and appetite loss. <p><br>(Description provided by Allbud.com and Cure Pennsylvania).",

The strain&#8217;s origins are poorly documented, but popular myth will tell you Hell&#8217;s OG was bred by biker ruffians in Southern California. If nothing else, we could assume this strain is named after its fierce psychoactive effects that settle in quickly and heavily. Lifting stress from the mind and pain from the body, Hell&#8217;s OG is a therapeutic strain commonly used to treat inflammation, insomnia, and PTSD.

Rumor has it that Northern Lights first sprouted near Seattle, Washington, but was propagated out of Holland after 1985 at what is now Sensi Seeds. Pungently sweet, spicy aromas radiate from the crystal-coated buds, which sometimes reveal themselves in hues of purple. Northern Lights psychoactive effects settle in firmly throughout the body, relaxing muscles and pacifying the mind in dreamy euphoria. Comfortable laziness allows patients to relieve pain and sleeplessness, while its mellow contentment roots out depression and stress. Several different Northern Lights phenotypes circulate the market. <p><br>Top Terpenes: B Myrcene, Terpinolene, Limonene, B Caryophyllene. <p><br>[Description Provided by Leafly.com and Cure Pennsylvania]",

A little goes a long way with this hybrid, whose THC heights have won GSC numerous Cannabis Cup awards.

The long history of the strain is traced back to the late 1970s when American breeder DJ Short was working with a variety of exotic landrace strains. However, throughout the decades of Blueberrys cultivation the genetics have been passed around, due in large part to DJ Short working with multiple seed banks and breeders. The sweet flavors of fresh blueberries combine with relaxing effects to produce a long-lasting sense of euphoria. Many consumers utilize Blueberry to help contend with pain and stress, while connoisseurs and growers admire the strain for its colorful hues and high THC content. <p><br>Top Terpenes: Caryophyllene, Myrcene, Humulene <p><br>(Description provided by Cure Pennsylvania &amp; Leafly.com)",

This form is a 4:1 ratio of CBD to THC. <p><br>Harle-Tsu, bred by the Southern Humboldt Seed Collective, is a high-CBD hybrid cross between Harlequin and Sour Tsunami.
